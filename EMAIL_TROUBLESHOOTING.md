# NASA Space Weather Forecaster - Email Troubleshooting

## 🎉 **Good News: Your Emails Are Working!**

Based on your Zoho inbox screenshot, the email system is working perfectly! The beautifully formatted NASA Space Weather Alert shows your system is operational.

## 🔧 **Dashboard Button Issue: "undefined" Error**

The dashboard email buttons are failing because the **API server isn't running** when you click them.

### ✅ **Solution: Proper Startup Sequence**

#### **Method 1: Use the New Launcher (Recommended)**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
start_dashboard_with_api.bat
```
This will:
1. Start the API server automatically
2. Wait for it to initialize  
3. Open the dashboard
4. Email buttons will work perfectly

#### **Method 2: Manual Startup**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start API Server
python dashboard_api.py

# Terminal 2: Open Dashboard (after API starts)
# Open professional_dashboard.html in browser
```

### 🕵️ **Why This Happens**

- **Dashboard buttons** need the API server running on `http://localhost:8001`
- **Direct Python scripts** work without the API server
- **Browser JavaScript** requires the API server for fetch() calls

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If problems persist:

1. **Check Windows Firewall** - Allow Python.exe through firewall
2. **Verify port 8001** - Make sure nothing else uses this port
3. **Browser console** - Check for JavaScript errors (F12)
4. **API server logs** - Look for error messages in the terminal
